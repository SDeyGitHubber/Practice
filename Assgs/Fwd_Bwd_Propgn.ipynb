    "The purpose of forward propagation in a neural network is to compute the predicted output for a given input. It involves passing the input data through the network's layers, applying transformations and activations, and producing an output that can be compared to the desired output during training."

    "Activation functions are used during forward propagation to introduce non-linearity to the output of a neuron. They allow neural networks to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Activation functions can be applied to the sum of weighted inputs in each neuron, transforming it into the output of the neuron."

    "#### Ans\n",
    "Weights and biases in forward propagation play a crucial role in determining the output of each neuron. The weights represent the strength of the connections between neurons, controlling the contribution of inputs to the output. Biases provide an additional constant input to each neuron, enabling them to have an influence even when the inputs are zero. By adjusting the weights and biases, the network can learn to produce the desired outputs."

    "The softmax function is commonly used in the output layer during forward propagation when dealing with multi-class classification problems. It transforms the output of the last layer into a probability distribution over multiple classes. The softmax function ensures that the sum of the probabilities for all classes is equal to 1, allowing the network to provide a normalized prediction for each class."

It allows the calculation of the derivative of a composite function by breaking it down into simpler functions and multiplying their derivatives. In the context of neural networks, the chain rule enables the calculation of the gradients at each layer by propagating the gradients from the subsequent layers backward, updating the weights and biases accordingly."
