Properly initializing the variance can help ensure stable training and better convergence."

He initialization differs from Xavier initialization in that it accounts for the specific activation function, which has a different scaling effect on the gradients. He initialization is preferred when using ReLU activations as it helps prevent the issue of \"dying\" ReLU units and allows for better learning in deep networks."
